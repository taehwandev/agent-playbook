# Feature Implementation Workflow

Use when implementing a new feature or meaningful behavior change.

## Read

- `common/agent-operating-skill.md`
- `common/llm-coding-discipline.md`
- `common/code-conventions.md`
- `common/product-spec-to-implementation.md`
- `workflows/development-cycle.md` for the full verify and side-effect audit cycle
- one matching platform architecture card
- task-specific common cards for touched API contracts, release config,
  accessibility, persistence, security, dependencies, or generated files

## Steps

1. Restate the requested behavior and assumptions.
2. Identify the smallest implementation boundary.
3. Check repo-local instructions, existing patterns, affected contracts, and affected tests.
4. Implement only the requested behavior.
5. Verify with the nearest useful command or manual smoke check.
6. Run the side-effect audit from `workflows/development-cycle.md`.
7. Report what changed, how it was verified, and any residual risk.

## Stop If

- The requirement has multiple incompatible interpretations.
- The implementation needs product policy not present in the repo.
- Verification is impossible and the risk is not acceptable to state explicitly.
