# Planning Research Workflow

Use when the task is to investigate, compare options, write an implementation
plan, assess risk, or prepare a recommendation before editing code.

## Read

- `workflows/agent-task-lifecycle.md`
- `common/architecture-selection.md` or `common/architecture-design.md` when structure is affected
- `common/product-spec-to-implementation.md` when behavior or acceptance criteria are unclear
- `common/security-privacy-review.md` when sensitive surfaces are involved
- platform or product-pattern cards from `index.md` for the affected domain

## Steps

1. State the question, decision, or plan outcome being produced.
2. Separate facts found locally, assumptions, unknowns, and user decisions.
3. Inspect existing code, docs, issues, tests, and conventions before proposing structure.
4. Identify affected boundaries, risks, and verification paths.
5. Prefer the smallest reversible plan that proves the goal.
6. Report recommended path, rejected alternatives, risks, and next concrete step.

## Stop If

- The plan would require product, legal, billing, security, or release policy that is not present.
- Current external information is required but cannot be verified.
- The recommendation depends on code or docs that have not been inspected.
