# Product Architecture Delivery Workflow

Use when a task should move from product intent to implementation through a full
delivery gate:

```text
PRD -> ARD -> Review -> Code Work -> Review -> Tests -> UI Tests -> Commit Readiness
```

This is a common workflow. Platform-specific cards decide how to implement and
verify each phase.

For agent execution, prefer the scripted route when available:

```text
python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py route product --platform <platform> --concern <concern>
```

Use that output as the command manifest before writing PRD or ARD.

## Scaled Use

Use the full PRD and ARD gates for non-trivial behavior, architecture, data,
security, contract, release, billing, or user-visible workflow changes.

For trivial changes, use a lightweight note instead of forcing full PRD/ARD.
A change is trivial only when all of these are true:

- no behavior, API, schema, auth, permission, billing, data, release, or
  dependency boundary changes
- no new user state, error path, persistence, external service, or background
  behavior
- no ambiguity that could change implementation or verification
- verification is obvious and narrow

The lightweight note should still name intent, touched boundary, and
verification. If any condition is false, use the full workflow.

## Read

- `workflows/agent-task-lifecycle.md`
- `workflows/ambiguity-gate.md` when product behavior, risk, scope, or verification is unclear
- `workflows/development-cycle.md`
- `common/product-spec-to-implementation.md`
- `common/architecture-selection.md`
- `common/architecture-design.md`
- `common/api-contract-compatibility.md` when contracts, DTOs, routes, events, or
  shared fixtures are touched
- `common/security-privacy-review.md` and `common/secure-development-baseline.md`
  when auth, permissions, user data, secrets, logs, external services, or public
  repositories are touched
- matching platform architecture, state/data, security, and review cards from
  `index.md`

## Platform Card Selection

Select platform cards from the affected surface before writing the ARD:

- Android app, Compose, ViewModel, Flow, Gradle, Android storage, permissions,
  background work, release build: Android cards.
- iOS app, SwiftUI/UIKit, actors/tasks, Keychain, app links, entitlements, signing:
  iOS cards.
- Web/React UI, routes, forms, browser storage, accessibility, i18n: Web cards.
- Server/API, database, jobs, webhooks, auth enforcement, queues: Server cards.
- Desktop/native shell, IPC, files, shell, clipboard, updates, signing:
  Application cards.

If multiple platforms are affected, load each matching platform architecture card
and one shared contract card. Do not load unrelated platforms just because the
repo is a monorepo.

## 1. PRD

Produce or update a product requirements note before coding when behavior is
non-trivial.

PRD must answer:

- Who is the user or system actor?
- What outcome should change?
- What states must exist: success, loading, empty, error, permission denied,
  offline, conflict, rollback?
- What data, auth, permission, billing, privacy, or external-service surfaces are
  touched?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- What open decisions block implementation?

Stop before ARD when product behavior is ambiguous enough to change architecture,
security, data, or verification.

## 2. ARD

ARD means architecture requirements and decision note. It translates the PRD into
implementation boundaries.

ARD must answer:

- Which platform cards were loaded and why?
- What owns UI, state, domain, data, platform, and integration responsibilities?
- What modules, packages, routes, endpoints, screens, or services are touched?
- What contracts change: API, DTO, event, route, schema, fixture, storage format,
  generated client, or deep link?
- Where are auth, permission, tenant, billing, secret, logging, and privacy
  boundaries enforced?
- What dependency, generated-file, migration, release, or compatibility risk
  exists?
- What is the smallest implementation slice?
- What verification proves the slice and what UI test or manual UI smoke is
  required if UI changes?

ARD should be short. Use repo-local ADR or design-doc format when it exists.
Otherwise leave a concise note in the task, PR, issue, TODO, or changed docs.

## 3. Pre-Code Review

Review PRD and ARD before implementation:

- Acceptance criteria are testable.
- Platform cards and concern cards match the affected surface.
- The implementation slice is narrow enough to review and revert.
- Security, data, contract, and release risks are visible.
- Verification and UI test paths are known or explicitly unavailable.

Do not start code work when this review finds a blocking product or architecture
decision.

For broad or high-risk changes, use `workflows/multi-perspective-review.md` to
check product, UX, architecture, reliability, security, release, and QA risk
before implementation.

## 4. Code Work

Use `workflows/development-cycle.md` for implementation.

Rules:

- Change only the ARD-scoped files.
- Keep dependency, generated, formatting, migration, and release churn separate
  when possible.
- Update docs, fixtures, or generated clients only when they are part of the
  scoped contract.
- Preserve user-owned changes.

## 5. Review

Inspect the final diff against PRD, ARD, repo-local rules, platform cards, and
`workflows/development-cycle.md` side-effect audit.

Review must confirm:

- The code satisfies the PRD acceptance criteria.
- The implementation follows the ARD boundaries or records why it changed.
- No unrelated behavior, refactor, dependency, generated, release, or formatting
  churn is mixed in.
- Security, privacy, contract, persistence, observability, and accessibility
  impacts were checked when touched.

## 6. Tests

Run the minimum verification that proves the changed boundary first. Then broaden
only when the side-effect audit or risk surface requires it.

Use `common/verification-policy.md` and the matching platform review card for the
exact command style.

## 7. UI Tests

Run UI verification when user-visible UI, navigation, layout, text, accessibility,
or interaction behavior changed.

UI verification can be automated or manual, but it must name the checked state:

- primary success path
- loading, empty, error, permission denied, or offline state when affected
- navigation or deep-link path when affected
- accessibility, long text, localization, responsive layout, or focus behavior
  when affected

If no UI changed, record UI test as not applicable.

## 8. Commit Readiness

Before commit or handoff, answer:

- Is the diff one reviewable intent?
- Does every changed line trace to PRD, ARD, verification, or required generated
  output?
- Are secrets, local config, debug logs, private data, build outputs, and
  unrelated artifacts absent from the diff?
- Did required tests pass, fail with understood cause, or get explicitly skipped
  with residual risk?
- Is rollback or forward-fix clear for migrations, release config, and contract
  changes?
- Can the commit message state what changed, why, and how it was verified without
  hiding uncertainty?

Output one of:

```text
Commit-ready: yes
Commit-ready: no - blockers: ...
Commit-ready: partial - safe subset: ... / remaining risk: ...
```

If PRD, ARD, verification, UI test, handoff, or commit-readiness gaps revealed a
repeatable lesson, run `workflows/retrospective-learning.md` after handoff.

## Stop If

- PRD acceptance criteria are missing for a non-trivial behavior change.
- ARD cannot identify platform cards, ownership boundaries, or verification.
- The task requires product, security, billing, legal, release, or data policy not
  present in the repo.
- UI changed but no UI verification or acceptable manual smoke path exists.
- Commit readiness would require hiding skipped checks, unrelated changes, or
  unresolved risk.
