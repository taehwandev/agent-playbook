# AgentPlaybook Shared Agent Instructions

This file is the entrypoint for agents that consult the shared AgentPlaybook library.

## Purpose

Use this library to prevent repeated mistakes across repositories. It provides
shared operating habits, review criteria, architecture principles, and platform
guidance. Repo-local instructions remain the source of truth for project paths,
commands, naming, domain rules, and product-specific policy.

## Language Policy

Write shared agent library documents in English. This includes `AGENTS.md`,
`index.md`, `common/`, `platforms/`, `product-patterns/`, `workflows/`, and
`templates/`. Public-facing site copy under `docs/` may be localized, but it
must not become the source of truth for agent guidance.

## Metadata Policy

Use frontmatter `status` as the readiness signal and `type` as provenance or
review state. Do not ignore a document only because `type` is `ai-generated`
when `status` is `review` or `stable`; instead, treat `draft` as provisional,
`review` as active, and `stable` as broad-use guidance. The `keyflow_id` field
is retained for metadata compatibility and should not be renamed casually.

## Priority

When instructions conflict, follow this order:

1. System and developer instructions from the active agent runtime.
2. The user's current request.
3. The target repo's local instructions, such as `AGENTS.md`,
   `AGENTS.override.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.agents/README.md`, or
   `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
4. More specific shared AgentPlaybook documents, such as platform or product-pattern docs.
5. Shared AgentPlaybook common cards.
6. General guidance in `README.md`.

If the conflict changes behavior, verification, security, or data handling, call
it out before or after the work.

## Always Read For Agent Work

For implementation, review, refactoring, debugging, documentation, or planning tasks, first consult:

```text
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/common/agent-operating-skill.md
```

Then load only the supporting documents relevant to the task.

## Required VibeGuard Gate

VibeGuard is mandatory for AgentPlaybook maintenance and for repos that apply
AgentPlaybook. Before documentation, code, configuration, dependency, data,
deployment, or credential changes, run the VibeGuard audit for the target repo.
For this repo, prefer the local or pinned VibeGuard source documented in
`VIBEGUARD.md`. During local maintenance, use:

```text
vibe-guard audit . --rules .
```

Run it again before finishing. Do not run an unpinned GitHub package in
unattended automation. Use `--fix` only for low-risk safety fixes, and never
print detected secret values. If VibeGuard cannot run, stop and report the
blocker instead of treating it as optional.

## Workflow Script

For repeated multi-step tasks, prefer the shared workflow router when available:

```text
python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py route <command> [--platform <platform>] [--concern <concern>]
```

Use the script output as a document and gate manifest, then execute the task with
the target repo's local commands. If the script is unavailable or the route is
missing a clearly relevant concern, fall back to `index.md` and report the gap.
Discover valid commands, platforms, and concerns with:

```text
python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py list
```

The route output contains `docs`, `gates`, `notes`, and `missing`. Read listed
documents in order, follow the gates as the task checklist, and stop if
`missing` is not empty. See
`workflows/scripted-agent-workflow.md` for the full consumption rules.

## Supporting Documents

Use `index.md` as the full document map. Do not duplicate the full index in
repo-local instructions. Start with these direct routes, then load only the
specific cards selected by `index.md`.

Release, versioning, platform, product-pattern, and other task-specific cards
are intentionally selected through `index.md` or `scripts/workflow.py` instead
of being listed as baseline direct routes here.

```text
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/index.md
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/common/stack-discovery.md
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/common/llm-coding-discipline.md
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/common/code-conventions.md
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/common/tool-failure-recovery.md
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/common/agent-interaction.md
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/common/agent-editing-safety.md
```

```

## Operating Rule

Do not copy this whole library into a repo. Link only the documents relevant to
that repo. Keep repo-specific paths, commands, role matrices, API names, and
domain language in the repo-local instructions.

`<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>` means the directory containing this shared library. In a
repo-local template, replace it with an existing local install path,
`${AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME}`, or a repo-pinned submodule path. `${KEYFLOW_AGENT_ROOT}`
is accepted only as a legacy local alias when already configured.
