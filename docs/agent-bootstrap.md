# AgentPlaybook Agent Bootstrap

Use when an AI coding agent receives the AgentPlaybook repository link or a
request to apply AgentPlaybook to a target project.

The goal is to connect the target repo to one reusable AgentPlaybook install. Do
not copy the full playbook into the target repo.

## Pasteable User Request

```text
Apply AgentPlaybook to this project:
https://github.com/taehwandev/AgentPlaybook

Before changing anything, read this project's current agent instructions first:
AGENTS.md, AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, .agents/README.md,
CONTRIBUTING.md, task docs, PRD/ARD docs, or equivalent project docs.

If AgentPlaybook already exists locally, link this repo to the existing copy.
Do not clone, vendor, or copy a second copy unless no usable local copy exists.
If a usable local copy exists but you think a fresh copy is needed, ask me
first: "AgentPlaybook already exists locally at <path>. Do you want me to
download or pin a new copy anyway, or should I reuse the existing root?"
Apply the required VibeGuard safety gate with the selected AgentPlaybook root
as the rule source. Use the published VibeGuard package command. The VibeGuard
site is a human reference and does not need to be fetched by the agent.
Update the repo-local agent instructions with a short routing block. Keep
repo-specific commands, paths, services, product policy, and domain language in
this repo. If existing Claude, Codex, Antigravity, or other runtime instruction
files are present, update the necessary AgentPlaybook pointer there in the same
pass. If the runtime reads AGENTS.md, do not create a duplicate runtime-specific
file.
```

For one-shot task use without editing repo-local instructions, use
`templates/use-agentplaybook-prompt.md`.

For runtime-specific setup across Codex, Claude, Antigravity, and generic
agents, use `docs/agent-runtime-integration.md`.

## Setup Decision

Choose the setup mode before editing the target repo:

1. Existing local install: use this when the user already has AgentPlaybook on
   the machine. Link to that root and do not clone or vendor a second copy
   unless the user explicitly approves a new copy after seeing the found path.
2. First-time local shared install: use this when no usable copy exists and the
   user wants one install reused across personal repos. Clone once to a stable
   path such as `~/.agent-playbook`.
3. Team-pinned install: use this when the repo needs a reviewed version shared
   by teammates and agents. Add a submodule, vendored dependency, or workspace
   dependency only after approval.

Always report which setup mode was selected before changing repo-local
instructions.

## Local Reuse Guard

Local reuse is the default and a hard stop for install work:

- If discovery finds a usable local or repo-pinned root, select `Existing local
  install`.
- Do not download, clone, vendor, copy, overwrite, or add a second
  AgentPlaybook root while a usable root exists.
- If there is a concrete reason to use a fresh copy anyway, ask before any
  network, git, submodule, or filesystem action:

  ```text
  AgentPlaybook already exists locally at <path>. Do you want me to download or
  pin a new copy anyway, or should I reuse the existing root?
  ```

- Continue with a new download or pinned copy only after explicit approval.

## Discovery Order

1. Identify the target project from the user's request and current working
   directory.
2. Read the target project's current agent instructions before changing files:
   `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`,
   `.agents/README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, task docs, PRD/ARD docs, or
   equivalent project docs.
3. Check whether the user supplied an explicit AgentPlaybook path.
4. Check `AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME`.
5. Check legacy `KEYFLOW_AGENT_ROOT` only when present.
6. Check common local installs such as `~/.agent-playbook`,
   `~/AgentPlaybook`, and `~/GitHub/AgentPlaybook`.
7. Check repo-pinned locations only when the target repo already contains one,
   such as `.agents/AgentPlaybook`, `tools/AgentPlaybook`, or a git submodule.

A usable AgentPlaybook root contains all of:

```text
AGENTS.md
index.md
scripts/workflow.py
```

If a usable root is found, use it. Do not reinstall.
When `scripts/agent-preflight.py` and `scripts/agent-finish-check.py` exist in
that root, they are the required evidence wrappers for multi-step work.

## Required VibeGuard Gate

VibeGuard is mandatory. After selecting the AgentPlaybook root, apply
VibeGuard to the target repo before editing target repo instructions. Use the
selected AgentPlaybook root as the VibeGuard rule source.

Do not choose `setup` or `update` by file existence alone. First inspect:

- current repo-local agent instructions
- `.vibeguard.json`
- `VIBEGUARD.md`
- any managed VibeGuard block

When the target already has instructions or guardrails, ask this application
drill before changing files:

```text
Application drill:
1. AgentPlaybook link style: add a short pointer, merge into the current
   instruction file, or pin a repo-local copy?
2. VibeGuard handling: audit only with current guardrails, refresh the managed
   block with update, or first-time setup?
3. Scope: apply now and continue the original task, or prepare instructions
   only?
```

Audit only, preserving existing guardrails:

```bash
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
```

Refresh an existing managed VibeGuard block only when the user explicitly
selects that option:

```bash
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard update . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --fix --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
```

Use `setup` only for first-time target repos with no guardrails:

```bash
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --fix --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
```

Full VibeGuard setup, audit, fix, package, and evidence flow lives in VibeGuard
docs for humans:

```text
https://vibeguard.thdev.app/
```

Do not block only because an agent browsing/fetch tool cannot read the
VibeGuard site. Continue with the package command shape above, and use
`npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard --help` if the current CLI surface must be
checked. If the VibeGuard command itself cannot run, stop and report the
blocker. Do not continue as if the safety gate were optional.

## Install If Missing

If no usable local or repo-pinned copy exists, choose one of these modes:

- Local shared install: clone once to `~/.agent-playbook`. This is best for
  individual users and multiple personal repos.
- Repo-pinned install: add AgentPlaybook as a git submodule or vendored
  dependency. This is best for teams that need a reviewed version.
Ask before using network access, adding a submodule, changing git remotes, or
writing outside the target repo.

After installing or selecting a root, run:

```bash
python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py validate
```

## Connect The Target Repo

1. Find the canonical repo-local instruction file. Prefer `AGENTS.md` when the
   active runtimes read it.
2. Also inspect existing runtime-specific instruction files, such as
   `AGENTS.override.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.agents/README.md`,
   Antigravity CLI docs, or an equivalent project guide.
3. Preserve existing repo-local instructions.
4. Confirm the required VibeGuard gate passed or stopped with a reported
   blocker.
5. Add a short AgentPlaybook routing block with the selected root path to the
   canonical instruction file.
6. Update existing runtime-specific files in the same pass by adding the same
   short pointer or by pointing them back to `AGENTS.md`.
7. Do not create new runtime-specific instruction files when the runtime already
   reads `AGENTS.md`.
8. Prefer `${AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME}` when the environment variable is configured.
   Otherwise use the absolute path or repo-relative submodule path.
9. Link only `AGENTS.md`, `index.md`, and any direct route cards the repo wants.
10. Do not paste the full AgentPlaybook library into repo-local files.
11. For multi-step setup or migration work, run
   `python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py route ... --request
   "<USER_REQUEST>"` before editing, keep the workflow route gate ledger,
   and verify every required gate is `GREEN` with evidence before reporting
   success.
12. When wrapper scripts are available, run
   `python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/agent-preflight.py ...` before edits
   and `python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/agent-finish-check.py ...` before
   final report, commit, release, or handoff. Missing wrapper evidence or gate
   evidence is non-compliant.

Use `templates/repo-agents-routing.md` as the routing block source.

## Verify

Before reporting success:

- The selected AgentPlaybook root exists.
- `AGENTS.md` and `index.md` exist under that root.
- The VibeGuard gate ran with the selected AgentPlaybook root as the rule
  source.
- Multi-step work has preflight and finish-check evidence when the wrapper
  scripts are available.
- The target repo's local instruction file still contains its original
  repo-specific rules.
- The routing block points to the selected root.
- Existing Claude, Codex, Antigravity, or other runtime instruction files are
  either updated with the same pointer or intentionally left unchanged with a
  reason.
- No duplicate runtime-specific instruction file was created when `AGENTS.md`
  is the runtime-read file.
- No secrets, local credentials, private prompts, or unrelated files were added.

## Stop If

- The target project is ambiguous.
- The user asked only for advice and did not ask to edit the repo.
- No usable local copy exists and network access is unavailable or not approved.
- The VibeGuard command cannot run after using the published package command.
- Existing repo-local instructions conflict with AgentPlaybook in a way that
  changes security, data handling, verification, deployment, or cost behavior.
