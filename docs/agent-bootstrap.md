# AgentPlaybook Agent Bootstrap

Use when an AI coding agent receives the AgentPlaybook repository link or a
request to apply AgentPlaybook to a target project.

The goal is to connect the target repo to one reusable AgentPlaybook install. Do
not copy the full playbook into the target repo.

## Pasteable User Request

```text
Apply AgentPlaybook to this project:
https://github.com/taehwandev/AgentPlaybook

Before changing anything, read this project's current agent instructions first:
AGENTS.md, AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, .agents/README.md,
CONTRIBUTING.md, task docs, PRD/ARD docs, or equivalent project docs.

If AgentPlaybook already exists locally, link this repo to the existing copy.
Do not clone, vendor, or copy a second copy unless no usable local copy exists.
Run VibeGuard setup or update, then audit with the selected AgentPlaybook root
as --rules.
Update the repo-local agent instructions with a short routing block. Keep
repo-specific commands, paths, services, product policy, and domain language in
this repo.
```

For one-shot task use without editing repo-local instructions, use
`templates/use-agentplaybook-prompt.md`.

For runtime-specific setup across Codex, Claude, Antigravity, and generic
agents, use `docs/agent-runtime-integration.md`.

## Setup Decision

Choose the setup mode before editing the target repo:

1. Existing local install: use this when the user already has AgentPlaybook on
   the machine. Link to that root and do not clone or vendor a second copy.
2. First-time local shared install: use this when no usable copy exists and the
   user wants one install reused across personal repos. Clone once to a stable
   path such as `~/.agent-playbook`.
3. Team-pinned install: use this when the repo needs a reviewed version shared
   by teammates and agents. Add a submodule, vendored dependency, or workspace
   dependency only after approval.

Always report which setup mode was selected before changing repo-local
instructions.

## Discovery Order

1. Identify the target project from the user's request and current working
   directory.
2. Read the target project's current agent instructions before changing files:
   `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`,
   `.agents/README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, task docs, PRD/ARD docs, or
   equivalent project docs.
3. Check whether the user supplied an explicit AgentPlaybook path.
4. Check `AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME`.
5. Check legacy `KEYFLOW_AGENT_ROOT` only when present.
6. Check common local installs such as `~/.agent-playbook`,
   `~/AgentPlaybook`, and `~/GitHub/AgentPlaybook`.
7. Check repo-pinned locations only when the target repo already contains one,
   such as `.agents/AgentPlaybook`, `tools/AgentPlaybook`, or a git submodule.

A usable AgentPlaybook root contains both:

```text
AGENTS.md
index.md
scripts/workflow.py
```

If a usable root is found, use it. Do not reinstall.

## Required VibeGuard Gate

VibeGuard is mandatory. After selecting the AgentPlaybook root, run VibeGuard
against the target repo before editing target repo instructions. For first-time
setup, run:

```bash
# First-time target repo:
vibeguard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

# Then audit:
vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
```

For an existing VibeGuard install, refresh first:

```bash
# Existing VibeGuard install:
vibeguard update . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

# Then audit:
vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
```

Use a local VibeGuard checkout, installed `vibeguard` binary, or repo-pinned
VibeGuard source when available. If no trusted local source is available, use a
reviewed GitHub package ref:

```bash
# First-time target repo:
npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibeguard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

# Existing VibeGuard install:
npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibeguard update . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

# Then audit:
npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
```

Replace `<VIBEGUARD_REF>` with a reviewed tag or commit. Do not run an unpinned
GitHub package command in unattended automation. Use `--fix` only after audit
output shows a low-risk safety fix and the target repo allows that automatic
change.

If VibeGuard cannot run, stop and report the blocker. Do not continue as if the
safety gate were optional.

When a runtime evidence adapter is configured, summarize VibeGuard execution
evidence before final reporting:

```bash
vibeguard evidence .
```

## Install If Missing

If no usable local or repo-pinned copy exists, choose one of these modes:

- Local shared install: clone once to `~/.agent-playbook`. This is best for
  individual users and multiple personal repos.
- Repo-pinned install: add AgentPlaybook as a git submodule or vendored
  dependency. This is best for teams that need a reviewed version.
Ask before using network access, adding a submodule, changing git remotes, or
writing outside the target repo.

After installing or selecting a root, run:

```bash
python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py validate
```

## Connect The Target Repo

1. Find the repo-local instruction file: `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`,
   `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.agents/README.md`, or an equivalent project
   guide.
2. Preserve existing repo-local instructions.
3. Confirm VibeGuard setup/update and audit passed or stopped with a reported
   blocker.
4. Add a short AgentPlaybook routing block with the selected root path.
5. Prefer `${AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME}` when the environment variable is configured.
   Otherwise use the absolute path or repo-relative submodule path.
6. Link only `AGENTS.md`, `index.md`, and any direct route cards the repo wants.
7. Do not paste the full AgentPlaybook library into the repo-local file.
8. For multi-step setup or migration work, keep the workflow route gate ledger
   and verify every required gate is `GREEN` with evidence before reporting
   success.

Use `templates/repo-agents-routing.md` as the routing block source.

## Verify

Before reporting success:

- The selected AgentPlaybook root exists.
- `AGENTS.md` and `index.md` exist under that root.
- VibeGuard setup/update and audit ran with the selected root as `--rules`.
- The target repo's local instruction file still contains its original
  repo-specific rules.
- The routing block points to the selected root.
- No secrets, local credentials, private prompts, or unrelated files were added.

## Stop If

- The target project is ambiguous.
- The user asked only for advice and did not ask to edit the repo.
- No usable local copy exists and network access is unavailable or not approved.
- VibeGuard cannot run locally, from a pinned repo source, or from a reviewed
  GitHub package ref.
- Existing repo-local instructions conflict with AgentPlaybook in a way that
  changes security, data handling, verification, deployment, or cost behavior.
