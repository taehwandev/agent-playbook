## Loading Rule

For coding, read `common/agent-operating-skill.md` and `common/llm-coding-discipline.md` first. Then read one platform architecture card. Add platform detail, common, or product-pattern cards only when the task touches that concern.

For Android work touching background execution, release builds, exported components, deep links, WebView, permissions, or secrets, load the Android background/security cards instead of relying only on the architecture card.

For desktop/application work touching menu bar/tray controls, shell/file/clipboard APIs, power assertions, IPC, signing, notarization, updates, or first launch, load the application system/security cards.

When the task touches keys, auth, permissions, user data, logs, analytics,
external integrations, local config, release config, or a public/open-source repo,
read `common/secure-development-baseline.md` before implementation.

For React/web feature work, usually read:

```text
common/llm-coding-discipline.md
platforms/web/web-architecture.md
platforms/web/web-state-data.md when state/data/storage is touched
platforms/web/web-accessibility-i18n.md when UI text, forms, menus, dialogs, or localization are touched
```

For review, read `common/code-review.md` first. Then read the matching platform review card. Add `common/security-privacy-review.md` and product-pattern cards only for affected auth, invite, billing, tenancy, or security concerns.

Stop reading when you can answer:

- What is the state owner?
- What are the UI, domain, data, and platform boundaries?
- What security, permission, persistence, or billing risks exist?
- What verification proves the goal?
- Which project-specific rules live in the repo?
