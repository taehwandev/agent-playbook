## Loading Rule

For any multi-step agent task, start with `workflows/agent-task-lifecycle.md`.
For multi-step development work, continue with `workflows/development-cycle.md`.
For coding, read `common/agent-operating-skill.md`,
`common/llm-coding-discipline.md`, and `common/code-conventions.md` first. Then
read one platform architecture card. Add platform detail, common, or
product-pattern cards only when the task touches that concern.

For documentation-only work, use `workflows/documentation-update.md`. For
planning, research, comparison, or recommendations before implementation, use
`workflows/planning-research.md`. For interrupted, long-running, or transferred
work, use `workflows/agent-handoff-continuation.md`.

For new project scaffolds, app names, repo names, package ids, modules, CLIs,
services, slugs, bundle ids, or renames, read `common/project-naming.md`.

For broad diffs, refactors, PR review, or commit preparation, also read
`common/change-size-policy.md`. For dependency, SDK, package, build plugin, or
lockfile work, read `common/dependency-policy.md`. For codegen, generated
clients, lockfiles, snapshots, build artifacts, translations, or generated
assets, read `common/generated-files-policy.md`.

For API, DTO, route, event, webhook, shared fixture, or generated client changes,
read `common/api-contract-compatibility.md`. For packaging, deployment,
publishing, signing, migration rollout, or rollback-sensitive work, read
`common/release-deployment.md`. For user-facing text, forms, controls, dates,
numbers, media, or localization, read `common/accessibility-i18n.md`.

For Android work touching background execution, release builds, exported components, deep links, WebView, permissions, or secrets, load the Android background/security cards instead of relying only on the architecture card.

For iOS work touching Keychain, Universal Links, URL schemes, app extensions,
WebViews, permissions, entitlements, signing, release builds, or secrets, load
the iOS security card instead of relying only on the architecture card.

For desktop/application work touching menu bar/tray controls, shell/file/clipboard APIs, power assertions, IPC, signing, notarization, updates, or first launch, load the application system/security cards.

When the task touches keys, auth, permissions, user data, logs, analytics,
external integrations, local config, release config, or a public/open-source repo,
read `common/secure-development-baseline.md` before implementation.

For React/web feature work, usually read:

```text
common/llm-coding-discipline.md
common/code-conventions.md
platforms/web/web-architecture.md
platforms/web/web-state-data.md when state/data/storage is touched
platforms/web/web-accessibility-i18n.md when UI text, forms, menus, dialogs, or localization are touched
```

For review, read `common/code-review.md` first. Then read the matching platform review card. Add `common/security-privacy-review.md` and product-pattern cards only for affected auth, invite, billing, tenancy, or security concerns.

Stop reading when you can answer:

- What is the state owner?
- What are the UI, domain, data, and platform boundaries?
- What security, permission, persistence, or billing risks exist?
- What verification proves the goal?
- Which project-specific rules live in the repo?
