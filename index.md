## Loading Rule

For any multi-step agent task, start with `workflows/agent-task-lifecycle.md`.
When `scripts/workflow.py` is available, use it to generate the command route
before manually selecting workflow documents. Treat the route's gate ledger as a
required execution record, not a summary to reconstruct after the work. Show a
short gate signal after each completed gate or task step.

For any new request, first classify clarity and effort with
`common/task-intake-effort-routing.md`. Do not use the strongest model, longest
reasoning, or full-document loading by default. Use quick effort for exact
low-risk requests, standard effort for scoped implementation, and deep effort
only for ambiguous, broad, high-risk, or cross-boundary work.

Before running project commands, adding dependencies, or using framework-specific
APIs, use `common/stack-discovery.md`. When a command fails, use
`common/tool-failure-recovery.md` before retrying or changing code. When the
agent needs to ask a blocker question or approval, use
`common/agent-interaction.md`.

For PRD-only work, use `workflows/prd-creation.md` and prefer this scripted
route:

```text
python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py route prd --platform <platform> --concern <concern>
```

For product or feature work that needs PRD -> ARD -> implementation ->
verification gates, use `workflows/product-architecture-delivery.md` and prefer
this scripted route:

```text
python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py route product --platform <platform> --concern <concern>
```

For lower-level multi-step development work, continue with
`workflows/development-cycle.md`. For vague or risky requests, use
`workflows/ambiguity-gate.md` before PRD, ARD, task breakdown, or
implementation. After a task, incident, handoff, repeated mistake, or missed
signal, use `workflows/retrospective-learning.md` only when there is a reusable
lesson. For coding, read
`common/agent-operating-skill.md`, `common/llm-coding-discipline.md`, and
`common/code-conventions.md` first. Then read one platform architecture card.
Add platform detail, common, or product-pattern cards only when the task touches
that concern.

For documentation-only work, use `workflows/documentation-update.md`. For wiki,
knowledge-base, runbook, onboarding, durable architecture, or operational docs
that humans and agents will read, also use `common/llm-wiki-documentation.md`.
For documentation review, use
`python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py route docs-review --concern wiki`
or manually combine `workflows/review-and-commit.md`,
`workflows/documentation-update.md`, and `common/llm-wiki-documentation.md`.
For planning, research, comparison, or recommendations before implementation,
use `workflows/planning-research.md`. For interrupted, long-running, or
transferred work, use `workflows/agent-handoff-continuation.md`.

For delegated or parallel agent work, use
`workflows/multi-agent-collaboration.md`. For non-trivial reviews, release
candidates, or changes that need product, UX, architecture, reliability,
security, and QA lenses, use `workflows/multi-perspective-review.md`.

For new project scaffolds, app names, repo names, package ids, modules, CLIs,
services, slugs, bundle ids, or renames, read `common/project-naming.md`.

For broad diffs, refactors, PR review, or commit preparation, also read
`common/change-size-policy.md`. When the worktree already contains changes or
the task includes commit preparation, also read `common/worktree-hygiene.md`.
When deciding file layout, package layout, module ownership, public contracts,
or `api`/`impl` splits, also read `common/code-structure-ownership.md`.
Do not make `api`/`impl` modules by default. Choose that split only when a
stable external contract, navigation/deep-link/registration boundary,
implementation swap, dependency isolation, ownership split, or cycle/build
coupling pressure exists.
When code is extracted into shared modules, reused by multiple callers, or
promoted into a package/API, also read `common/reusable-code-design.md`.
When designing reusable UI components, hooks, widgets, controls, or other
caller-facing component APIs, also read `common/component-api-design.md`.
For dependency, SDK, package, build plugin, or lockfile work, read
`common/dependency-policy.md`. For codegen, generated clients, lockfiles,
snapshots, build artifacts, translations, or generated assets, read
`common/generated-files-policy.md`.

For API, DTO, route, event, webhook, shared fixture, or generated client
changes, read `common/api-contract-compatibility.md`. For packaging,
deployment, publishing, signing, migration rollout, or rollback-sensitive work,
read `common/release-deployment.md`. For release version, package version, app
version, build number, tag, artifact name, or deployment id changes, also read
`common/release-versioning.md`. For user-facing text, forms, controls, dates,
numbers, media, or localization, read `common/accessibility-i18n.md`.

For uploads, downloads, generated files, media, attachments, signed or temporary
URLs, public/private asset movement, asset cleanup, or asset references embedded
in persisted content, read `common/asset-lifecycle.md`.

For sitemap, robots, metadata, Open Graph previews, short links, public search,
canonical URLs, link previews, structured data, or public discovery feeds, read
`common/public-discovery.md`.

For code that consumes external, persisted, generated, cached, platform, or
user-provided values, read `common/defensive-boundaries.md`.

For UI, application, async, cache, reducer, store, ViewModel, hook, or state
machine work, read `common/state-modeling.md`.

For error handling, typed failures, retries, and user-visible failure states,
read `common/error-modeling.md`. Add `common/observability-error-handling.md`
when logs, metrics, diagnostics, support traces, or audits are touched.

For UI layout, visible state, interaction, text overflow, responsive behavior,
or accessibility-visible changes, read `common/ui-visual-verification.md`.

For server-rendered data, API response caching, framework data cache,
request-level memoization, edge/CDN cache, database query cache, materialized
read models, or cache invalidation, read `common/server-side-caching.md`.

For Android work touching background execution, release builds, exported
components, deep links, WebView, permissions, or secrets, load the Android
background/security cards instead of relying only on the architecture card.

For Android Compose screen or component work, load
`platforms/android/android-compose-ui.md` before implementation. This includes
stateful/stateless boundaries, previews, component package structure, and
design-system promotion decisions.

For Android ViewModel, `UiState`, Flow, repository, persistence, or one-off
event work, load `platforms/android/android-viewmodel-state.md` before
implementation.

For KMP or Compose Multiplatform work, load
`platforms/kmp/kmp-architecture.md`. For shared Compose UI, also load
`platforms/kmp/kmp-compose-ui.md`; for shared state, repositories,
coroutines, persistence, or adapters, load `platforms/kmp/kmp-state-data.md`;
for source sets, `expect`/`actual`, native interop, files, shell, clipboard,
permissions, or target capabilities, load
`platforms/kmp/kmp-platform-integration.md`.

For Flutter work, load `platforms/flutter/flutter-architecture.md`. For
widgets, forms, routes, design-system components, or golden/widget tests, also
load `platforms/flutter/flutter-widget-ui.md`; for state owners, streams,
repositories, storage, or async effects, load
`platforms/flutter/flutter-state-data.md`; for MethodChannel, EventChannel,
plugins, permissions, lifecycle, isolates, desktop, mobile, or web target
behavior, load `platforms/flutter/flutter-platform-integration.md`.

For iOS SwiftUI screen or component work, load
`platforms/ios/ios-swiftui-ui.md` before implementation. This includes
route/screen/section boundaries, ViewModel contracts, explicit `UiState`,
architecture tracks, previews, and design-system promotion decisions.

For iOS UIKit screen or component work, load `platforms/ios/ios-uikit-ui.md`
before implementation. This includes coordinator/view-controller boundaries,
typed UI state, lists, forms, navigation, and UI tests.

For iOS work touching Keychain, Universal Links, URL schemes, app extensions,
WebViews, permissions, entitlements, signing, release builds, or secrets, load
the iOS security card instead of relying only on the architecture card.

For desktop/application work touching menu bar/tray controls, shell, file,
clipboard APIs, power assertions, IPC, signing, notarization, updates, or first
launch, load the application system/security cards.

For desktop/application UI, commands, windows, panels, shortcuts, menu bar/tray,
background tasks, or renderer bridges, load
`platforms/application/application-command-ui.md`.

For server API, GraphQL, RPC, webhook, route handler, validation, use case,
repository, response shape, or API error work, load
`platforms/server/server-api-implementation.md`.

When the task touches keys, auth, permissions, user data, logs, analytics,
external integrations, local config, release config, or a public/open-source
repo, read `common/secure-development-baseline.md` before implementation.

For React/web feature work, usually read:

```text
common/llm-coding-discipline.md
common/code-conventions.md
platforms/web/web-architecture.md
platforms/web/web-react-ui.md
platforms/web/web-state-data.md when state/data/storage is touched
platforms/web/web-accessibility-i18n.md when UI text, forms, menus, dialogs,
or localization are touched
```

For review, read `common/code-review.md` first. Then read the matching platform
review card. Add `common/security-privacy-review.md` and product-pattern cards
only for affected auth, invite, billing, tenancy, or security concerns.

Stop reading when you can answer:

- What is the state owner?
- What are the UI, domain, data, and platform boundaries?
- What security, permission, persistence, or billing risks exist?
- What verification proves the goal?
- Which project-specific rules live in the repo?
