# LLM Coding Discipline

Use before coding. These rules reduce common LLM mistakes. Bias toward caution over speed; use judgment for trivial tasks.

## Think First

- State assumptions when they affect implementation.
- If multiple interpretations exist, surface them.
- Ask when ambiguity changes the result.
- Push back on unnecessary scope or complexity.

## Keep It Simple

- Build only what was asked.
- No speculative features, config, flexibility, or abstractions.
- No single-use abstraction.
- If the solution feels much larger than the problem, simplify.

## Change Surgically

- Touch only lines tied to the request.
- Match existing style.
- Do not refactor adjacent code unless required.
- Remove only unused code created by your change.
- Mention unrelated dead code; do not delete it.

## Verify The Goal

Turn work into one to three concrete checks before or during the change:

```text
1. User request -> observable outcome -> verification evidence.
2. Risk touched -> guardrail or regression check -> verification evidence.
```

Examples:

- README install guidance changed -> links and commands still resolve -> run
  markdown link/path check or document why it cannot run.
- Login error behavior changed -> invalid login shows the expected error and
  valid login still works -> run the focused test or manual path.
- Refactor without intended behavior change -> public behavior stays equivalent
  -> run the existing narrow test or compare before/after behavior.

If success cannot be verified, name the gap before proceeding.
