# Agent Interaction

Use when an agent needs clarification, approval, a status update, or a handoff
message.

## Default

Keep momentum. Ask only when the answer can change behavior, safety,
architecture, data handling, cost, or external state. Otherwise make a
reasonable assumption, state it briefly, and proceed.

## Questions

When a question is needed:

- Ask one to three questions at most.
- Prefer concrete choices over open-ended prompts.
- Include the recommended option first when there is a clear recommendation.
- State the tradeoff or consequence for each option.
- Name the default assumption if the user does not answer and it is safe to
  continue.

Use this shape:

```text
Decision needed:
- A: ... (recommended) - consequence
- B: ... - consequence

Default if safe:
```

## Approval Requests

Ask for explicit approval before destructive work, external writes, credential
changes, deploys, package publishes, migrations, paid usage increases, or
network/package execution that is not already trusted by repo-local policy.

Approval requests should name the command or action, target, and risk. Do not
treat approval for one risky action as permission for unrelated risky actions.

## Status Updates

For long-running work, report what context was gathered, what changed in the
plan, and what verification remains. Keep updates short and evidence-based.

## Handoff

When stopping before completion, include:

- current goal
- files changed or inspected
- commands run and results
- blockers or decisions needed
- safest next step
