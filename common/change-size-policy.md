# Change Size Policy

Use when deciding how much code to change, whether to split work, or whether a
diff is reviewable.

## Default

Prefer one narrow vertical slice that can be understood, tested, and reverted.

Small is not the goal by itself. The goal is a change with one clear intent and
enough surrounding code to be correct.

## Reviewable Unit

A good change usually has:

- one behavior, bug fix, refactor, or infrastructure purpose
- one primary owner boundary
- focused tests or a clear smoke check
- no unrelated formatting, generated churn, dependency update, or cleanup

## Split Signals

Consider splitting when:

- behavior change and refactor are both substantial
- formatting or generated files obscure the real diff
- a dependency update is mixed with product behavior
- migrations, API contracts, permissions, or billing rules change alongside UI work
- more than about 10 source files or 300 non-test lines changed without a single obvious intent
- rollback would require reverting unrelated behavior

Do not split when the pieces cannot compile, test, migrate, or make sense
independently.

## Large Change Requirements

For a large but necessary change, record:

- why it cannot be split safely
- which files are mechanical versus behavioral
- what verification covers the risky parts
- what rollback or forward-fix path exists

## Avoid

- Broad cleanup while implementing a feature.
- Moving files and changing behavior in the same diff without a reason.
- Using generated churn to hide manual edits.
- Leaving placeholder behavior that makes the diff look complete.

## Check

- Can this be reviewed in one pass?
- Can this be reverted without removing unrelated work?
- Does every changed line trace to the stated purpose?
- Would a smaller slice still prove the product or technical goal?
