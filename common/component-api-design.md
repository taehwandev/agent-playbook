# Component API Design

Use when designing reusable UI components, view components, hooks, widgets,
controls, SDK helpers, or any caller-facing component-like API.

A component API should make valid use easy, invalid use hard, and product policy
visible in the caller rather than hidden inside the component.

## API Shape

Prefer:

- Plain values, immutable view models, or small parameter objects.
- Explicit callbacks for user intent or command output.
- Slots/children/render callbacks when the structure is reusable but content
  belongs to the caller.
- Typed states for loading, empty, error, disabled, selected, and permission
  states.
- Stable defaults that do not perform side effects.
- One root customization hook such as `modifier`, `className`, `style`, or
  equivalent, following the platform idiom.

Avoid:

- Passing repositories, routers, activities, controllers, stores, or service
  locators into reusable components.
- Boolean flag APIs that encode caller names, modes, or product variants.
- Components that fetch data, decide navigation, log analytics, enforce product
  permissions, and render UI at the same time.
- Hidden global config reads or environment-dependent behavior.
- Copying a whole screen state into a leaf component when a smaller model works.

## Controlled State

Make ownership explicit:

- Caller-owned state: pass value plus change callback.
- Component-local state: keep only transient interaction state such as focus,
  hover, expanded, drag, animation, or draft text when persistence is not needed.
- External state: expose callbacks or commands; do not mutate remote data inside
  the component without a documented owner boundary.

If a component can be both controlled and uncontrolled, document the precedence
or avoid supporting both until there is a real caller need.

## Naming

- Name the component by its reusable role: `SearchField`, `MetricTile`,
  `PlacePreviewSheet`.
- Name callbacks by user intent: `onRetryClick`, `onQueryChange`, `onDismiss`.
- Name slots by position or responsibility: `leadingIcon`, `trailingContent`,
  `media`, `actions`.
- Avoid names tied to the first screen unless the component is feature-local.

## Product Boundary

Reusable components should not own:

- product-specific copy
- route decisions
- analytics event names
- permission policy
- billing or entitlement policy
- tenant/user data filtering
- network/cache/persistence behavior

Those decisions stay in the caller, state holder, domain policy, or integration
adapter. The component exposes enough callback/state surface for the caller to
make the decision.

## Examples And States

Every reusable component should have at least one example, preview, fixture, or
focused test covering the common state. Add edge examples when affected:

- loading and disabled
- empty and error
- selected and unselected
- long text and localization
- missing media or icon
- permission denied or read-only
- small screen or constrained container

## Review Checklist

- Can this component be used by a second caller without feature flags?
- Does the caller still own product policy and navigation?
- Are inputs minimal but complete?
- Are outputs explicit and typed?
- Is accessibility part of the API contract?
- Can the component be tested or previewed in isolation?
