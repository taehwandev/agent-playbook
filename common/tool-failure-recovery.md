# Tool Failure Recovery

Use when a build, test, lint, typecheck, formatter, package, script, or local
tool command fails.

## Default

Do not blindly retry, broadly revert, or silence the failure. Read the actual
stdout/stderr, identify the failing boundary, and make the smallest correction
that addresses the observed error.

## Diagnose

Capture the useful facts before editing:

- command, working directory, and exit code
- first failing file and line number, when present
- error code, exception type, test name, or assertion message
- whether the failure is from code, config, missing dependency, environment,
  sandbox, permissions, network, timeout, or flaky external state
- whether the failing area was touched by the current task

If output is truncated, rerun the narrowest command that exposes the relevant
error. Do not paste secret values from logs.

## Correct

- Fix the smallest relevant code, config, test, fixture, or docs issue.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and unrelated failures.
- Rerun the narrowest command that proves the correction.
- Escalate or ask only when the failure requires network, credentials,
  destructive cleanup, external state, or a product decision.
- If the same command fails twice for different reasons, repeat diagnosis from
  the new output instead of assuming the old cause.

## Flaky Failures

Treat a failure as flaky only when there is evidence of nondeterminism, such as
intermittent pass/fail behavior, timeout, race, external service instability, or
order-dependent tests.

When flakiness is suspected:

- Rerun the smallest failing test or command once to confirm the pattern.
- Check whether the failure depends on time, random order, parallel execution,
  network, filesystem state, cache, or shared external state.
- Do not mark the work verified just because one retry passed.
- Stabilize the test or isolate the nondeterministic boundary when it is in
  scope.
- If stabilization is out of scope, report the flaky signal, rerun count,
  observed results, and residual risk.

## Clean Build Or Cache Recovery

Use clean rebuilds only after output suggests stale artifacts, corrupted cache,
generated-file mismatch, dependency resolution drift, or build-system state.

Before cleaning:

- Prefer repo-local clean commands or documented wrappers.
- Identify the cache or artifact being removed.
- Avoid deleting global caches, user data, simulator state, derived data, or
  dependency stores without approval.
- Keep dependency reinstall, generated output, and lockfile changes separate
  from code fixes unless the task requires them.

Examples of acceptable local recovery paths when repo-local policy allows them:

```text
package-manager clean/build command from the repo
project clean task or build wrapper
targeted generated-client regeneration
targeted local build output deletion
```

## Do Not

- Repeat the same failing command more than twice without a changed hypothesis.
- Run broad cache deletion or reinstall commands without evidence and approval.
- Delete tests, loosen assertions, or bypass lint rules only to make checks pass.
- Catch and ignore runtime errors to hide a failing path.
- Roll back broad files when a line-level correction is available.
- Mark verification as passed when the command failed for environment reasons.

## Report

For unresolved failures, report:
