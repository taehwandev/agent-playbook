# Code Conventions

Use when writing, changing, or reviewing code style, naming, structure,
comments, errors, and formatting.

Repo-local conventions, formatter, linter, and language idioms win over this
common baseline.

For app, repo, package, module, CLI, service, slug, or bundle-id naming, also
use `common/project-naming.md`.

For file/module ownership, public contract, package layout, or `api`/`impl`
split decisions, also use `common/code-structure-ownership.md`.

For code that is being extracted, moved into shared modules, reused by multiple
callers, or promoted to a package/API, also use
`common/reusable-code-design.md`.

For reusable component-like APIs, callbacks, slots, and controlled state, also
use `common/component-api-design.md`. For state shape, source of truth, async
states, and one-off effects, use `common/state-modeling.md`. For typed failures
and retry/recovery behavior, use `common/error-modeling.md`.

## Priority

1. Repo-local formatter, linter, compiler, and framework rules.
2. Existing local patterns in the touched area.
3. Language and platform idioms.
4. This shared baseline.

## Rules

- Make code easy to delete, move, and test.
- Treat reuse as an ownership boundary. Extract shared code only when the caller
  contract is clear enough to make future changes easier.
- Prefer clear names over comments that explain unclear names.
- Keep each function, component, class, hook, or service focused on one reason to change.
- Keep UI, state, domain, data, and platform concerns separated at the nearest useful boundary.
- Pick the smallest structure that protects a real boundary; do not create a
  package or module only to mirror a preferred architecture.
- Do not add a new abstraction for one call site unless it protects a risky boundary.
- Do not scatter booleans for roles, permissions, entitlements, loading, or error states when a typed state or policy object would make behavior clearer.
- Prefer typed errors, result objects, or framework error types over string matching.
- Avoid hidden global state, implicit environment behavior, and hard-coded production data.
- Keep user-facing copy out of low-level logic when the repo has i18n or copy ownership.
- Comments should explain why, risk, contract, or non-obvious constraints. Do not narrate obvious code.

## Formatting

- Run the repo formatter or lint fix when configured.
- Do not reformat unrelated files or whole files unless the change requires it.
- Keep generated formatting churn separate from behavior changes when possible.
- Do not hand-edit generated code unless the repo documents that generated file as source.

## Size Signals

These are review signals, not universal failure thresholds:

- A function or component over about 150 lines often has more than one responsibility.
- A source file over about 400 lines often needs clearer sections or extraction.

Split only when it improves ownership, testability, or review. Do not create
extra files just to satisfy a line count.
For diff-size and split decisions, use `common/change-size-policy.md`.

## Check

- Can a reviewer name the responsibility of this unit in one sentence?
- Can the behavior be tested without booting unrelated systems?
- Is shared code genuinely reusable, or did it only move duplication behind a
  flag-heavy API?
- Did this follow nearby naming, formatting, and architecture?
- Is any complexity protecting a real product, platform, security, or data risk?
