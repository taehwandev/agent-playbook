# Commit Workflow

Use before creating commits, regardless of git client, IDE, CLI, or AI tool.

## Commit Unit

- One commit should carry one reviewable intent.
- Do not mix feature, refactor, formatting, generated files, and dependency churn unless they are inseparable.
- Every changed line should trace to the commit purpose.
- If a commit needs a long explanation, consider splitting it first.
- Use `common/change-size-policy.md` when a diff is broad or hard to review.
- Use `common/generated-files-policy.md` when generated files, lockfiles, or snapshots changed.

## Before Commit

- Check repo-local commit rules first.
- Inspect the final diff, not memory of the work.
- Remove only unused code created by this change.
- Run the nearest useful verification, or record why it was skipped.
- Do not include secrets, local paths, debug logs, or temporary artifacts.
- Call out API contract, migration, release, accessibility, or security impact
  when the commit touches those surfaces.

## Message

Prefer:

```text
type(scope): what changed

Why:
- reason or product context

Verified:
- command or manual check
```

Keep the subject about behavior or structure, not effort. Mention migrations, breaking changes, security impact, and follow-up work explicitly.

## Common Types

- `feat`: user-facing capability or product behavior
- `fix`: bug fix or regression repair
- `refactor`: structure change with no intended behavior change
- `test`: tests, fixtures, or verification support
- `docs`: documentation only
- `chore`: tooling, config, maintenance, or repository housekeeping
- `build`: build system, packaging, dependency, or lockfile change
- `perf`: performance improvement
- `security`: security hardening, secret handling, auth, or permission fix

Repo-local commit types win when they differ.
