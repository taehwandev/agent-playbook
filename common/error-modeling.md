# Error Modeling

Use when designing, handling, mapping, logging, retrying, or displaying errors.

Error handling is part of the product contract. A failure should be traceable by
engineering, understandable by the user when visible, and safe for data,
security, privacy, and retries.

## Error Layers

Keep these layers separate:

```text
raw exception / transport failure
-> boundary error
-> domain failure
-> user-visible state/message
-> diagnostic log/metric/audit event
```

- Raw exceptions stay near the boundary that produced them.
- Boundary errors describe API, database, filesystem, platform, SDK, or network
  failure in typed form.
- Domain failures describe product meaning such as denied, unavailable,
  conflict, quota exceeded, invalid state, or not found.
- User-visible messages explain what happened and what the user can do next.
- Logs and metrics support debugging without leaking sensitive data.

## Typed Shape

Prefer typed errors, result objects, or sealed failure models with fields such as:

```text
code
category
retryable
recoverable
status / transport status
field errors
correlation id
safe message key
cause
```

Do not rely on string matching unless the upstream API leaves no alternative;
if string matching is unavoidable, isolate it in one adapter and test it.

## Retry And Recovery

Classify failures before retrying:

- Retryable: timeout, temporary unavailable, rate limit with backoff, transient
  network loss.
- User-recoverable: invalid input, missing permission, expired session, conflict,
  quota exceeded.
- Non-retryable: forbidden, unsupported operation, validation impossible, missing
  required resource.
- Dangerous to retry: payment, destructive mutation, duplicate message, external
  side effect without idempotency.

Retries need idempotency, backoff, cancellation, duplicate handling, and a stop
condition.

## Handling Rules

- Do not swallow errors silently.
- Do not convert failure into success to make a command, UI path, or test pass.
- Preserve the cause when wrapping or mapping errors.
- Map boundary failures once at the boundary; do not duplicate mapping in every
  caller.
- Keep user-facing copy out of low-level error types when the repo has i18n or
  copy ownership.
- Never log secrets, tokens, credentials, private prompts, raw personal data, or
  full request/response bodies unless the repo explicitly permits redacted logs.
- If an error is intentionally ignored, keep the scope narrow and document why it
  cannot affect correctness, data integrity, security, billing, permissions, or
  user-visible completion.

## UI Failure States

User-visible failures should choose an explicit state:

```text
inline field error
blocking empty/error state
retryable banner/snackbar
permission denied state
offline/stale-content state
conflict resolution state
silent best-effort fallback
```

Silent fallback is acceptable only when the feature still satisfies the user goal
and diagnostics exist for unexpected failure.

## Review Checklist

- Where is the raw failure converted into a typed error?
- Is the error retryable, recoverable, or terminal?
- Can retries duplicate side effects?
- What does the user see?
- What can support or engineering trace?
- Are sensitive values excluded from logs, analytics, crash reports, and audits?
- Are tests covering denied, invalid, timeout, stale, and conflict paths when
  relevant?
