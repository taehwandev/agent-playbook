# Use AgentPlaybook Prompt

Paste this into Claude, Antigravity, Codex, or another AI coding agent when the
target repo is not yet wired to AgentPlaybook or when you want a one-shot task
to follow AgentPlaybook explicitly.

Replace the placeholders before sending.

```text
Use AgentPlaybook for this task.

Target repo:
<TARGET_REPO_OR_CURRENT_DIRECTORY>

Task:
<TASK>

AgentPlaybook root:
<AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

VibeGuard source:
<LOCAL_OR_PINNED_VIBEGUARD_SOURCE>

Rules:
1. Identify the target repo and read repo-local instructions first, including
   AGENTS.md, AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, .agents/README.md,
   CONTRIBUTING.md, or equivalent project docs.
2. Do not assume this runtime automatically loaded AgentPlaybook. Explicitly
   read <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/AGENTS.md and <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/index.md.
3. Do not copy the whole AgentPlaybook library into this repo. Link only the
   relevant root, index, workflow script, and selected cards.
4. VibeGuard is required. Before editing documentation, code, config,
   dependency, data, deployment, or credential surfaces, run:
   vibe-guard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
   If the local command is unavailable, use the local or pinned VibeGuard source
   I provided. Do not run an unpinned GitHub package command in unattended
   automation. If VibeGuard cannot run, stop and report the blocker.
5. For multi-step tasks, run:
   python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py list
   python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py route <COMMAND> [--platform <PLATFORM>] [--concern <CONCERN>]
   Use the route output as the command manifest.
6. Load only the listed documents and the smallest relevant platform, product,
   or common cards. Do not load every shared document by default.
7. Discover the repo stack before choosing package managers, framework APIs, or
   project commands. Preserve user-owned worktree changes.
8. When commands fail, read stdout/stderr and fix only the smallest relevant
   issue. Do not blindly retry, delete tests, or silence errors.
9. Ask only blocker questions. Prefer concrete options with tradeoffs and a
   recommended default.
10. Before finishing, rerun the relevant verification and VibeGuard audit, then
    report changed files, checks run, skipped checks, and residual risk.
```

## Choosing The Route

Use these common command profiles:

- General task: `task`
- Product PRD/ARD to implementation: `product`
- Feature: `feature`
- Bug or failing command: `bugfix --concern failure`
- Documentation update: `docs --concern wiki`
- Documentation review: `docs-review --concern wiki`
- Code review or commit readiness: `review`
- Release or versioning: `release`

Add `--platform web`, `--platform ios`, `--platform android`,
`--platform server`, or `--platform application` when a platform is touched.
Repeat `--concern` for each touched risk area.
