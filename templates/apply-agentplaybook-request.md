# Apply AgentPlaybook Request

Paste this into an AI coding agent when you want it to connect a project to
AgentPlaybook.

Use `templates/use-agentplaybook-prompt.md` instead when you only want one task
to follow AgentPlaybook without changing repo-local instruction files.

```text
Apply AgentPlaybook to this project:
https://github.com/taehwandev/AgentPlaybook

Before changing anything, read this project's current agent instructions first:
AGENTS.md, AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, .agents/README.md,
CONTRIBUTING.md, task docs, PRD/ARD docs, or equivalent project docs.

Use an existing local AgentPlaybook install if one is available. Check an
explicit path from me first, then AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME, then common local clones
such as ~/.agent-playbook or ~/GitHub/AgentPlaybook.

Select one setup mode and tell me which one you selected before editing:

- Existing local install: if a usable install exists, link this repo to that
  copy. Do not clone, vendor, or copy a second copy.
- First-time local shared install: if no usable install exists, ask before
  cloning once to ~/.agent-playbook.
- Team-pinned install: ask before adding AgentPlaybook as a repo-pinned
  submodule, vendored dependency, or workspace dependency.

A usable AgentPlaybook root must contain AGENTS.md, index.md, and
scripts/workflow.py. Validate it with:

python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py validate

VibeGuard is required. After selecting the AgentPlaybook root, run VibeGuard
setup for a first-time repo or update for an existing VibeGuard install, then
audit with that root as --rules. Use a local, repo-pinned, or team-approved
VibeGuard source when available:

First-time target repo:
vibeguard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

Existing VibeGuard install:
vibeguard update . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

Then audit:
vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

If no trusted local source exists, use a reviewed GitHub package tag or commit:

First-time target repo:
npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibeguard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

Existing VibeGuard install:
npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibeguard update . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

Then audit:
npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

Do not run an unpinned GitHub package command in unattended automation. Use
--fix only after audit output shows a low-risk safety fix and this repo allows
that automatic change.

If VibeGuard cannot run, stop and tell me the blocker.

Update the repo-local agent instructions, such as AGENTS.md,
AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, or .agents/README.md, with a short
routing block. Preserve existing project rules. Keep repo-specific commands,
paths, services, product policy, and domain language in this repo.

For any multi-step setup or follow-up task, run the workflow route and show a
gate signal after each completed gate or task step:

Gate signal: GREEN | gate: <gate> | evidence: <evidence> | next: <next gate>

Completion requires every required gate to be GREEN. YELLOW means blocked or
paused. RED means the gate was missed or lacks evidence and must use missed-gate
recovery.

After connecting it, verify that the referenced AgentPlaybook AGENTS.md and
index.md files exist, confirm VibeGuard is passing, then continue with my
original task.
```

For a team-pinned install, add this sentence:

```text
Prefer a repo-pinned submodule or vendored dependency so every teammate and
agent uses the same reviewed AgentPlaybook version.
```
