# Apply AgentPlaybook Request

Paste this into an AI coding agent when you want it to connect a project to
AgentPlaybook.

Use `templates/use-agentplaybook-prompt.md` instead when you only want one task
to follow AgentPlaybook without changing repo-local instruction files.

## Step 1: Required Application Prompt

```text
Step 1 - Apply AgentPlaybook to this project:
https://github.com/taehwandev/AgentPlaybook

Before changing anything, open and read this project's current agent instructions first:
AGENTS.md, AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, .agents/README.md,
CONTRIBUTING.md, task docs, PRD/ARD docs, or equivalent project docs.
Do not rely on implicit runtime discovery: Codex-style agents must explicitly
read the current project's AGENTS.md or AGENTS.override.md, Claude must
explicitly read CLAUDE.md when present, and Antigravity or generic agents must
explicitly read the project instruction document they are configured to load.
Do not claim the file was read unless you actually opened it.

Use an existing local AgentPlaybook install if one is available. Check an
explicit path from me first, then AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME, then common local clones
such as ~/.agent-playbook or ~/GitHub/AgentPlaybook.

If any usable local or repo-pinned AgentPlaybook root exists, stop install
selection there and reuse it. Do not download, clone, vendor, copy, overwrite,
or add a second AgentPlaybook root unless I explicitly approve after you ask:
"AgentPlaybook already exists locally at <path>. Do you want me to download or
pin a new copy anyway, or should I reuse the existing root?"

Select one setup mode and tell me which one you selected before editing:

- Existing local install: if a usable install exists, link this repo to that
  copy. Do not clone, vendor, or copy a second copy.
- First-time local shared install: if no usable install exists, ask before
  cloning once to ~/.agent-playbook.
- Team-pinned install: ask before adding AgentPlaybook as a repo-pinned
  submodule, vendored dependency, or workspace dependency.

A usable AgentPlaybook root must contain AGENTS.md, index.md, and
scripts/workflow.py. Validate it with:

python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/workflow.py validate

VibeGuard is required. After selecting the AgentPlaybook root, apply VibeGuard
with the selected AgentPlaybook root as the rule source.

Before changing files, inspect this repo's current agent instructions,
.vibeguard.json, VIBEGUARD.md, and any managed VibeGuard block.

If this repo already has instructions or guardrails, ask me this application
drill before running setup or update:

1. AgentPlaybook link style: add a short pointer, merge into the current
   instruction file, or pin a repo-local copy?
2. VibeGuard handling: audit only with current guardrails, refresh the managed
   block with update, or first-time setup?
3. Scope: apply now and continue my original task, or prepare instructions only?

If I choose audit-only:

npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

If I explicitly choose to refresh the managed VibeGuard block:

npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard update . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --fix --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

If this repo has never used VibeGuard and I choose first-time setup:

npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --fix --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

For full VibeGuard usage, use https://vibeguard.thdev.app/ as a human
reference. Do not block only because your browsing/fetch tool cannot read that
site. Continue with the package command shape above, and use
`npx --yes @taehwandev/vibeguard --help` if you need to confirm the CLI.

If VibeGuard cannot run, stop and tell me the blocker.

Update the repo-local agent instructions, such as AGENTS.md,
AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, or .agents/README.md, with a short
routing block. Preserve existing project rules. Keep repo-specific commands,
paths, services, product policy, and domain language in this repo.

Prefer AGENTS.md as the canonical instruction file when the active runtimes read
it. If repo-local Claude, Codex, Antigravity CLI, or other runtime instruction
files are present, update their AgentPlaybook pointer in the same pass or point
them back to AGENTS.md. Do not create a separate runtime-specific file only to
duplicate guidance when the active runtime already reads AGENTS.md.

For any multi-step setup or follow-up task, run the workflow route with
`--request "<USER_REQUEST>"` before selecting task documents, editing,
reviewing, committing, or reporting completion. If the request is a direct
question, answer it before routing or editing. If the direct question asks how
to start app, product, or feature work, answer with PRD -> ARD ->
implementation gates before lower-level coding steps. If the task proceeds into
code, use the `product` route unless an existing PRD/ARD or repo-local
instruction makes the slice clearly trivial. If the workflow router cannot run,
stop and report the blocker before continuing. Show a gate signal after each
completed gate or task step:

Gate signal: GREEN | gate: <gate> | evidence: <evidence> | next: <next gate>

Completion requires every required gate to be GREEN. YELLOW means blocked or
paused. RED means the gate was missed or lacks evidence and must use missed-gate
recovery.

When the wrapper scripts are available, run preflight before editing, reviewing,
committing, or reporting completion:

python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/agent-preflight.py --project . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT> --command <COMMAND> --request "<USER_REQUEST>" [--platform <PLATFORM>] [--concern <CONCERN>]

Before final report, commit, release, or handoff, run finish check with evidence
for every required route gate:

python3 <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>/scripts/agent-finish-check.py --project . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT> --gate "request intake=<evidence>" --gate "orient=<evidence>" --gate "scope=<evidence>" --gate "act=<evidence>" --gate "verify=<evidence>" --gate "report=<evidence>"

The wrappers write local evidence under .agentplaybook/. Missing wrapper
evidence or missing gate evidence is non-compliant even if the final files look
correct. If final VibeGuard is YELLOW / Needs review, report it explicitly and
pass --allow-vibeguard-review with a reason only when that review state is
acceptable.

After connecting it, verify that the referenced AgentPlaybook AGENTS.md and
index.md files exist, confirm the VibeGuard gate is passing, then continue with
my original task.
```

## Step 2: Optional User-Level Bridge Prompt

```text
Optional Step 2 - Register a user-level runtime bridge on this machine.

Use this only if I choose the optional setup for better future agent behavior.
Preserve existing personal instructions. Add or update a short managed block; do
not replace unrelated user content.

Update the active user-level file for the runtime I choose:
Codex -> ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
Claude -> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
Antigravity CLI -> ~/.antigravitycli/AGENTS.md
Antigravity SDK/IDE -> check ~/.antigravity and ~/.antigravity-ide for the
instruction file the active runtime loads.

The bridge must force this behavior:
- Start every task by identifying the current project root.
- Before project work, open the project-root instruction file for the active runtime.
- Codex reads AGENTS.md / AGENTS.override.md.
- Claude reads CLAUDE.md.
- Antigravity reads its project instruction document, .antigravitycli,
  .agents/README.md, or AGENTS.md.
- Do not claim an instruction file was read unless you actually opened it.
- If I ask a direct question, answer it before routing, editing, or running commands.
- If I ask how to start app, product, or feature work, include PRD -> ARD ->
  implementation before lower-level coding steps.
- If my request is ambiguous and the answer changes behavior, scope, safety, or
  external state, ask before working.
- For multi-step tasks, require AgentPlaybook preflight and finish-check
  evidence when those wrapper scripts are available; missing wrapper or gate
  evidence is non-compliant.
```

For a team-pinned install, add this sentence:

```text
Prefer a repo-pinned submodule or vendored dependency so every teammate and
agent uses the same reviewed AgentPlaybook version.
```
