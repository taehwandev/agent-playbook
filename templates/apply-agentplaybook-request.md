# Apply AgentPlaybook Request

Paste this into an AI coding agent when you want it to connect a project to
AgentPlaybook.

Use `templates/use-agentplaybook-prompt.md` instead when you only want one task
to follow AgentPlaybook without changing repo-local instruction files.

```text
Apply AgentPlaybook to this project:
https://github.com/taehwandev/AgentPlaybook

Use an existing local AgentPlaybook install if one is available. Check an
explicit path from me first, then AGENTPLAYBOOK_HOME, then common local clones
such as ~/.agent-playbook or ~/GitHub/AgentPlaybook.

If a usable install exists, link this repo to that copy. Do not clone, vendor,
or copy a second copy.

If no usable install exists, ask before cloning to ~/.agent-playbook or adding
AgentPlaybook as a repo-pinned submodule.

VibeGuard is required. After selecting the AgentPlaybook root, run VibeGuard
setup and audit with that root as --rules. Use a local, repo-pinned, or
team-approved VibeGuard source when available:

vibe-guard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
vibe-guard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

If no trusted local source exists, use a reviewed GitHub package tag or commit:

npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibe-guard setup . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>
npm --no-update-notifier exec --yes --package github:taehwandev/VibeGuard#<VIBEGUARD_REF> -- vibe-guard audit . --rules <AGENTPLAYBOOK_ROOT>

Do not run an unpinned GitHub package command in unattended automation. Use
--fix only after audit output shows a low-risk safety fix and this repo allows
that automatic change.

If VibeGuard cannot run, stop and tell me the blocker.

Update the repo-local agent instructions, such as AGENTS.md,
AGENTS.override.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, or .agents/README.md, with a short
routing block. Preserve existing project rules. Keep repo-specific commands,
paths, services, product policy, and domain language in this repo.

After connecting it, verify that the referenced AgentPlaybook AGENTS.md and
index.md files exist, confirm VibeGuard is passing, then continue with my
original task.
```

For a team-pinned install, add this sentence:

```text
Prefer a repo-pinned submodule or vendored dependency so every teammate and
agent uses the same reviewed AgentPlaybook version.
```
