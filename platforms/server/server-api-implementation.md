# Server API Implementation

Use when creating, changing, moving, or reviewing HTTP handlers, GraphQL
resolvers, RPC methods, webhooks, service methods, repositories, API validation,
tenant boundaries, or response contracts.

For database transactions, migrations, queues, schedules, and webhooks, also
read `server-data-jobs.md`. For auth, tenant isolation, input, SSRF, rate
limits, and secrets, also read `server-security.md`.

## API Layers

Use this shape unless the repo has a stricter local pattern:

```text
Route/Resolver -> Request DTO/Validator -> Use Case/Service
-> Repository/Client -> Database/External System
```

- Route/resolver owns transport concerns: params, body, headers, status codes,
  response shape, and framework middleware.
- Validator owns parsing, normalization, allowlists, and safe defaults.
- Use case/service owns product rules, authz decisions, idempotency, and
  side-effect orchestration.
- Repository owns persistence queries and transaction boundaries.
- Client owns external API calls, retries, timeout, error mapping, and provider
  DTO conversion.

Do not put validation, permission checks, database queries, external calls, and
response shaping all inside one handler.

## Handler Contract

Every endpoint should identify:

- actor: authenticated user, service, webhook provider, anonymous caller
- tenant/workspace/account scope
- permission or entitlement needed for the action
- accepted input fields and rejected server-owned fields
- idempotency key when retries can duplicate side effects
- rate limit or abuse boundary when the endpoint is expensive or public
- success response, stable error shape, and HTTP status code
- audit log, correlation id, and privacy-safe diagnostics

## Request Validation

- Validate path params, query params, body, headers, file metadata, and webhook
  payload before product logic.
- Normalize emails, slugs, ids, dates, currencies, locale, pagination, sort, and
  filter values at the boundary.
- Use explicit field allowlists to prevent mass assignment.
- Keep server-owned fields such as role, tenant id, billing status, owner id,
  createdBy, quota, and audit fields out of client-controlled writes.
- Bound pagination, search, includes, sort, filter, batch size, upload size, and
  timeout.
- Treat malformed input as a typed, user-safe error, not an internal exception.

## Use Case Rule

Use cases should:

- Receive typed input and actor/context, not raw request objects.
- Recheck auth, permission, tenant, entitlement, and resource existence.
- Own transaction and idempotency decisions when multiple writes or side effects
  are involved.
- Return typed result or domain error that route code maps to response shape.
- Trigger side effects through named ports/clients so tests can isolate them.

Avoid use cases that only forward to one repository method without enforcing a
rule, transaction, side effect, or test boundary.

## Repository And Query Rule

- Tenant filters should be required by construction, not optional call-site
  details.
- Use parameterized queries, safe ORM APIs, and explicit include/sort/filter
  allowlists.
- Keep database entities out of public API responses unless they are already the
  documented API contract.
- Model uniqueness, constraints, foreign keys, and soft-delete behavior in the
  repository or schema boundary.
- Define transaction isolation, retry, rollback, and forward-fix behavior for
  multi-write invariants.

## Response And Error Shape

- Map domain errors to stable response codes and payloads.
- Avoid leaking whether private users, tenants, resources, invites, tokens, or
  billing accounts exist unless product policy allows it.
- Include correlation id or request id where the repo standard supports it.
- Keep retryability explicit for clients when useful.
- Never return stack traces, provider credentials, SQL, secrets, or internal
  provider payloads to callers.

## Tests

Choose the closest checks configured in the repo:

- Handler/route tests for request parsing, validation, response shape, and
  status codes.
- Use case tests for permission, tenant, entitlement, idempotency, and product
  rules.
- Repository tests for query constraints, transactions, migrations, uniqueness,
  soft delete, and cross-tenant isolation.
- Contract tests or generated-client checks for public API changes.
- Security tests for unauthenticated, forbidden, cross-tenant, mass assignment,
  injection-shaped input, rate limit, malformed payload, and secret/log leaks.

Review the final diff for optional tenant filters, client-controlled server
fields, raw request objects in use cases, database entities in responses,
duplicated permission logic, and side effects outside idempotent boundaries.
