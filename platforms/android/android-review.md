# Android Review

Use for Android app, Compose/ViewModel, permission, and UI flow review.

## Review

- Check Compose state hoisting, ViewModel ownership, Flow collection, and lifecycle safety.
- Check ViewModel, `UiState`, Flow, repository, and one-off event boundaries
  against `android-viewmodel-state.md` when state/data changed.
- Check stateful holder vs stateless screen/component boundaries.
- Confirm meaningful screen, section, and reusable component changes include
  previews or a documented replacement check.
- Verify loading, empty, error, permission-denied, and offline states.
- Ensure repository/data source boundaries are not bypassed from UI.
- Check permission, activity result, navigation argument, and process recreation behavior.
- Confirm secrets and user data are not logged.
- Check WorkManager, foreground service, notification, and retry behavior when background work is touched.
- Review exported components, deep links, WebView bridges, PendingIntent mutability, and cleartext traffic when security surfaces change.

## Tools

- Static: Gradle lint, ktlint/detekt if configured.
- Unit: JVM tests for mapper, validator, policy, ViewModel state.
- Instrumented: AndroidJUnitRunner for framework-dependent behavior.
- UI: Compose UI Test or Espresso for screen interactions.
- Screenshot: Paparazzi or screenshot tests if the repo uses them.
- Flow: Turbine or equivalent for stream behavior when configured.
- Performance: Macrobenchmark or baseline profile for startup and critical flows when configured.

## UI Test Focus

- Screen renders expected state from fake ViewModel/state.
- Stateless screen and component previews cover the changed visual states.
- User actions emit correct events or trigger expected navigation.
- Permission denied and retry flows are covered.
- Rotation, process death, or lifecycle changes do not lose critical state.
- Background jobs do not duplicate side effects after retry or process death.
- Release build configuration does not expose debug endpoints, secrets, or broad exported components.
