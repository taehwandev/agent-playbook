# Android ViewModel And State

Use when creating, changing, moving, or reviewing Android ViewModels, `UiState`,
`Flow`, use cases, repositories, persistence, permission state, or navigation
events.

For Compose screen/component structure, also read `android-compose-ui.md`. For
background work, also read `android-background-work.md`. For reusable extraction,
also read `../../common/reusable-code-design.md`.

## State Ownership

Use this shape unless the repo has a stricter local pattern:

```text
Route/Composable -> ViewModel -> Use Case -> Repository -> DataSource/Adapter
```

- Route/Composable collects state, sends user intent, and handles lifecycle-aware
  UI effects.
- ViewModel owns screen state, user intent handling, cancellation, and event
  output.
- Use case owns product rules and orchestration when logic is reused, risky, or
  independently testable.
- Repository owns source coordination, caching, DTO/domain mapping, and error
  normalization.
- Data sources/adapters own Room, DataStore, files, sensors, permissions,
  notifications, SDKs, and network clients.

Do not add a use case or repository only as a pass-through. Add it when it
protects a product rule, side effect, test boundary, cache boundary, or platform
API boundary.

## ViewModel Contract

ViewModels should expose one observable state stream and explicit intent methods
or typed actions:

```kotlin
data class ProfileUiState(
    val content: ProfileViewData? = null,
    val status: LoadStatus = LoadStatus.Loading,
    val permission: PermissionState = PermissionState.Unknown,
    val snackbar: SnackbarMessage? = null,
)

sealed interface ProfileAction {
    data object Retry : ProfileAction
    data object Edit : ProfileAction
    data object DismissMessage : ProfileAction
}
```

Rules:

- Prefer immutable `data class` or sealed state over scattered `MutableState`
  and nullable fields.
- Keep `MutableStateFlow` private and expose `StateFlow`.
- Use lifecycle-aware collection from UI.
- Convert DTO/domain models into UI models before state reaches Compose.
- Keep permission denied, offline, empty, loading, error, disabled, and submitted
  states representable when the flow can reach them.
- Keep one-off effects separate from persistent state. Use a typed effect stream
  or route callback for navigation, snackbar, permission launch, external
  activity, and file/share actions.

## Implementation Pattern

Use repo-local naming and DI first, but keep this contract intact:

```kotlin
data class ProfileUiState(
    val status: ProfileStatus = ProfileStatus.Loading,
    val canEdit: Boolean = false,
)

sealed interface ProfileStatus {
    data object Loading : ProfileStatus
    data object Empty : ProfileStatus
    data class Content(val profile: ProfileViewData) : ProfileStatus
    data class Error(val message: UiMessage) : ProfileStatus
    data object PermissionDenied : ProfileStatus
}

sealed interface ProfileAction {
    data object RetryClick : ProfileAction
    data object BackClick : ProfileAction
    data object EditClick : ProfileAction
}

sealed interface ProfileEffect {
    data object NavigateBack : ProfileEffect
    data class OpenEditor(val id: ProfileId) : ProfileEffect
    data class ShowSnackbar(val message: UiMessage) : ProfileEffect
}
```

```kotlin
class ProfileViewModel(
    private val loadProfile: LoadProfileUseCase,
) : ViewModel() {
    private val _state = MutableStateFlow(ProfileUiState())
    val state: StateFlow<ProfileUiState> = _state.asStateFlow()

    private val _effects = Channel<ProfileEffect>(Channel.BUFFERED)
    val effects: Flow<ProfileEffect> = _effects.receiveAsFlow()

    fun onAction(action: ProfileAction) {
        when (action) {
            ProfileAction.RetryClick -> load()
            ProfileAction.BackClick -> emitEffect(ProfileEffect.NavigateBack)
            ProfileAction.EditClick -> openEditor()
        }
    }

    private fun load() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            _state.update { it.copy(status = ProfileStatus.Loading) }
            // Map domain result into typed UI state, including empty/error.
        }
    }

    private fun openEditor() {
        val content = _state.value.status as? ProfileStatus.Content ?: return
        emitEffect(ProfileEffect.OpenEditor(content.profile.id))
    }

    private fun emitEffect(effect: ProfileEffect) {
        viewModelScope.launch { _effects.send(effect) }
    }
}
```

Implementation rules:

- Keep action handling centralized in the ViewModel or reducer; do not scatter
  business actions across composables.
- Use `Channel`/`receiveAsFlow`, `SharedFlow`, or repo-local event primitives
  intentionally. Effects should not replay after rotation unless replay is the
  product contract.
- Convert repository/domain errors into typed UI messages or state. Do not pass
  raw exceptions to Compose.
- Put required content data inside the `Content` state, or use another explicit
  state shape when stale content can coexist with refresh/error. Avoid nullable
  payloads that contradict the status.
- Prefer a single `onAction(ProfileAction)` surface when a screen has many
  events. Explicit callbacks are fine for small screens.
- Persist only durable inputs needed for process recreation. Do not persist
  snackbars, transient navigation effects, or one-frame UI commands.

## Flow And Coroutine Rules

- Use `viewModelScope` for work owned by the ViewModel.
- Use `viewModelScope.launch { ... }` for one-shot suspend work such as loading,
  submit, retry, or save actions.
- Use `onEach { ... }.launchIn(viewModelScope)` for long-lived Flow
  subscriptions owned by the ViewModel, such as event buses, repositories, or
  platform callbacks that should keep collecting while the ViewModel is active.
- Use `stateIn(viewModelScope, started, initial)` when a Flow is transformed
  into UI-observed `StateFlow`; do not use `launchIn` only to copy Flow values
  into mutable UI state when `stateIn` can express the state owner directly.
- Inject dispatchers, clocks, and schedulers when tests need control.
- Cancel or replace in-flight work when query, account, permission, or route
  arguments change.
- Suppress stale results from older requests.
- Use `stateIn` or `shareIn` intentionally; define initial value, sharing
  policy, and stop timeout.
- Avoid collecting infinite flows inside use cases without a clear owner.
- Map errors into user-visible state or typed domain errors before UI.

## Persistence And Cache

- Room entities, DataStore schemas, files, and cache records should not leak
  directly into UI state.
- Version persisted data that can survive app upgrades.
- Define cleanup on logout, account switch, org/workspace change, permission
  revoke, and downgrade.
- Define invalidation for offline caches and remote refresh.
- Handle corrupt DataStore/files, failed migrations, missing permissions, and
  storage quota or disk errors.

## Navigation And Events

- Parse navigation arguments at the route boundary and pass typed values to the
  ViewModel.
- Do not hide route decisions in random booleans inside `UiState`.
- Navigation, snackbar, permission prompt, file picker, and external app launch
  should be explicit outputs from the state owner.
- Events must not replay after rotation unless replay is the intended behavior.

## Tests

Choose the closest checks configured in the repo:

- ViewModel tests for state transitions, retry, submit, permission denied,
  stale result suppression, and one-off effects.
- Reducer or action tests when the feature uses MVI-style state transitions.
- Use case tests for product rules, auth/tenant/billing policy, and side-effect
  orchestration.
- Repository tests for cache, mapper, error, migration, and source selection.
- Coroutine tests with injected dispatchers and deterministic clocks.
- Compose UI tests for lifecycle collection, rendering state, and emitted
  actions.

Review the final diff for direct data-source calls from UI, public mutable
state, impossible UI state combinations, replaying one-off events, missing
logout cleanup, and untested coroutine timing.
