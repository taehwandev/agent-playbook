# Application Security

Use for desktop/native app security: Mac apps, Tauri, Electron, menu bar tools, local files, shell access, update flows, IPC, and privileged OS APIs.

## Rules

- Keep file, shell, clipboard, notification, accessibility, power, and update APIs behind narrow adapters.
- Route menu bar, shortcut, toolbar, and panel actions through the same command or use case.
- Treat IPC, URL schemes, app links, and renderer bridges as trust boundaries.
- Never expose broad shell, filesystem, environment, or credential APIs directly to renderer or plugin code.
- Keep local file paths, tokens, private prompt text, clipboard content, and user file contents out of logs.
- Signing, notarization, auto-update, first launch, quarantine, and permission prompts require explicit smoke coverage.
- Release assertions, timers, event monitors, background tasks, and OS resources on stop, expiry, app quit, and failure rollback.

## Mac App Notes

- `NSStatusItem`, menu bar extras, popovers, panels, windows, and global monitors need a single clear owner.
- Panel/window lifecycle state should not be the source of product state.
- System behaviors such as Accessibility, power assertions, file bookmarks, notifications, and login items are best-effort and must fail visibly.
- Public APIs and distribution constraints matter; private APIs create maintenance, trust, and notarization risk.

## Check

- Can the same action run consistently from menu, shortcut, toolbar, tray, and panel?
- Which OS permission, entitlement, or signing state is required?
- What resource must be cleaned up on app quit, cancellation, failure, or timeout?
- Could an untrusted renderer, URL, file, plugin, or external app trigger this action?
- Does the release artifact prove signing, notarization/update, and first-launch behavior?
