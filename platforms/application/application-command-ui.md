# Application Command And UI

Use when creating, changing, moving, or reviewing desktop/native app windows,
panels, menu bar/tray items, shortcuts, commands, local state, background tasks,
IPC bridges, or UI tests.

For shell, file, clipboard, notification, power, update, and OS integration
details, also read `application-system-integration.md`. For privileged APIs,
IPC, signing, notarization, and update trust, also read
`application-security.md`.

## Application Layers

Use this shape unless the repo has a stricter local pattern:

```text
Window/Panel/View -> Presentation State -> Command/Use Case
-> App Service -> System Adapter
```

- Window/panel/view owns rendering, focus, layout, user intent, and presentation
  lifecycle.
- Presentation state owns visible loading, error, permission, progress, and
  selection state.
- Command/use case owns product action semantics and can be invoked from menu,
  shortcut, toolbar, tray/menu bar, or UI.
- App service owns orchestration, persistence, and background work.
- System adapter owns filesystem, shell, clipboard, notification, accessibility,
  power assertions, login items, updater, OS handles, and IPC.

## Command Rule

Every user action that can be triggered from more than one entry point should
route through one command path:

```text
menu item -> Command
shortcut -> Command
toolbar button -> Command
tray/menu bar item -> Command
panel button -> Command
```

The command should define:

- enabled/disabled state
- required permission, entitlement, file access, or OS capability
- input validation
- cancellation behavior
- progress reporting
- user-visible error
- cleanup on failure, timeout, cancellation, and app quit

Do not duplicate action logic in menu handlers, button handlers, IPC handlers,
and shortcut callbacks.

## Window And State Rule

- Window visibility, position, focus, and restoration state are not product
  state.
- Product state should survive close/reopen only when the product requires it.
- Panels, popovers, menu bar extras, and secondary windows need one owner.
- App launch, first run, restore, sign out, permission revoke, update, and quit
  should define state cleanup.
- UI should render loading, empty, error, permission denied, offline/unavailable,
  progress, disabled, and success states when reachable.

## IPC And Renderer Bridge

For Tauri, Electron, WebView, plugin, or renderer/main-process apps:

- Expose narrow typed commands, not broad filesystem, shell, environment, or
  credential APIs.
- Validate all renderer, URL, file, drag/drop, plugin, and external-app inputs.
- Keep privileged work in the trusted process or native layer.
- Treat IPC payloads as untrusted input even when the UI created them.
- Return stable, user-safe errors and log private detail only in safe logs.

## Background Work And OS Resources

- Long-running work needs cancellation, progress, timeout, retry, and
  user-visible failure state.
- Timers, event monitors, file watchers, power assertions, background tasks,
  sockets, and OS handles need explicit owners.
- Release resources on stop, failure, timeout, cancellation, logout, app quit,
  and window deallocation where applicable.
- Do not leave menu bar/tray indicators, monitors, or assertions active after
  the command has stopped.

## File Layout

A desktop feature can use:

```text
Features/Capture/
  CaptureWindow.swift / CapturePanel.tsx
  CaptureState.swift / captureState.ts
  CaptureCommand.swift / captureCommand.ts
  CaptureService.swift / captureService.ts
  System/
    ClipboardAdapter.swift / clipboardAdapter.ts
    FileBookmarkStore.swift / fileBookmarkStore.ts
  Tests/
```

Adapt names to Swift, Rust/Tauri, Electron, or the repo's local structure while
preserving command and adapter ownership.

## Tests

Choose the closest checks configured in the repo:

- Command tests for enabled state, validation, permission failure,
  cancellation, progress, and user-visible errors.
- Adapter tests for filesystem, clipboard, shell, notification, update, or
  permission behavior where the repo supports fakes.
- UI tests for window open/restore/close, menu/shortcut/tray consistency, forms,
  and permission prompts.
- Packaging smoke for signing, notarization, first launch, update, and
  quarantine behavior when release surfaces change.

Review the final diff for duplicated menu/button logic, privileged renderer
APIs, product state stored as window state, missing cleanup, hidden background
work, and private file/token/clipboard data in logs.
